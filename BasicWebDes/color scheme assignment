The color scheme I've created is based on the theme "Sunset at the Beach". The four colors in this scheme are "Golden Sun", "Crimson Sky", "Azure Sea", and "Sandy Beach".


Here is the HTML table with the color names and their corresponding hex, rgb, and hsl values:


Color Name	Hex Value	RGB Value	HSL Value
Golden Sun	#FFD700	rgb(255, 215, 0)	hsl(51, 100%, 50%)
Crimson Sky	#DC143C	rgb(220, 20, 60)	hsl(348, 83%, 47%)
Azure Sea	#1E90FF	rgb(30, 144, 255)	hsl(210, 100%, 56%)
Sandy Beach	#F4A460	rgb(244, 164, 96)	hsl(28, 87%, 67%)

The table is constructed using HTML and CSS. The header of the table is the name of the color scheme, "Sunset at the Beach", styled with a different font to differentiate it from other text in the table. Each cell in the "Color Name" column has its background color set to the color it represents.


The hex, rgb, and hsl values are different methods to represent a color. Hex values are six-digit hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, while RGB values are based on the red, green, and blue color model. HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness, another way to represent colors.
